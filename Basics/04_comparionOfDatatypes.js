// comparitive operators 
/* > - greater 
   >= - greater or equals to
   < - lesser
   <= - lesser or equals to 
   == - equals too 
   === - strict check , compares value and data type , returns boolean value 

   comparison should be never done between two differnt types 
    ex - ("2" > 1 ) - answer maybe predictable , js converts string into number and compares and results true value 
    but its not same in the every case , so comparing two different data types is a bad practices */
